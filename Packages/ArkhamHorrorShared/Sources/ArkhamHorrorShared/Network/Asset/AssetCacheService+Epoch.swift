/// The unified mutation authority shared by every cache-mutating operation
/// on ``AssetCacheService``: a normal fetch's eventual publish
/// (``AssetCacheService/asset(for:)``), a revalidation's eventual
/// 404/304/200 outcome (``AssetCacheService/performRevalidation(_:)``),
/// and ``AssetCacheService/evictAll()``. Split out of
/// `AssetCacheService.swift`/`AssetCacheService+Revalidation.swift` purely
/// to keep those files within this package's `file_length` convention.
///
/// Every one of those operations suspends at least once (a network round
/// trip; for a disk hit, a disk-cache actor hop and a full platform
/// decode) between the moment it starts and the moment it would mutate
/// shared cache state, and two overlapping operations for the same key
/// can complete in an order that has nothing to do with the order they
/// were *issued* in (whichever suspends longer simply finishes later). A
/// design that only asks "has anything changed since I started" cannot
/// tell those two situations apart: if an older-issued operation happens
/// to finish first, nothing has changed yet, so it would wrongly be
/// treated as still authoritative — and the *actually* newer-issued
/// operation, finishing later, would then find its own naive "unchanged"
/// check now failing and be wrongly rejected. ``CacheToken`` instead
/// records *issuance* order directly: authority belongs to whichever
/// operation was issued last for a given key, full stop, regardless of
/// completion order.
///
/// - ``AssetCacheService/keyIssuance``: the highest issuance number ever
///   handed out for one specific key, incremented by every fresh
///   (never-coalesced) operation at the moment it is issued.
/// - ``AssetCacheService/keyLatestToken``: the single token recorded as
///   authoritative for a key — always the most recently *issued* one,
///   never merely the most recently *completed* one.
/// - ``AssetCacheService/globalGeneration``: bumped once by
///   ``AssetCacheService/evictAll()``, invalidating every token already
///   issued for every key at once (including keys not yet present in
///   `keyLatestToken` at all) without needing to enumerate them.
///
/// A `CacheToken` is issued exactly once, synchronously, at the moment an
/// operation is *issued* (never re-issued later for that same logical
/// operation; coalesced waiters share the one token issued when the
/// shared operation itself began), and checked via
/// ``AssetCacheService/isAuthoritative(_:for:)`` immediately before every
/// point that operation is about to touch memory/disk state — including
/// again after a further suspension, if one occurs between two such
/// checks — and independently re-checked *inside* ``AssetMemoryCache``
/// and ``AssetDiskCache`` themselves (see their own `token:`-accepting
/// entry points), so a stale write can never land even if this actor's
/// own outer check happened to pass moments before a newer operation's
/// issuance. A 404, a 304, and a fresh 200 are all gated identically:
/// none of them is treated as unconditionally authoritative regardless of
/// timing, because a *stale* 404 (a slow response to an old request,
/// completing after a newer request already published fresh content) is
/// just as capable of wrongly resurrecting/destroying state as a stale
/// 304 or 200 would be.
